Working on the global state for the player
should be able to create a playlist
 - playlist can have a min of 1 track, else the snackbar doesnt show
    (referencing the actual spotify app the snackbar never closes, idk if its just me)
    (anyway onboarding, this state should be empty obviously )
    (on the event of playing a song, the current song should persist, ttl Infinity)
    (with that said, probably a cache or redux persist, idk how the later works, lets check)
    (cool, so that will come later)
    (lets work with this)
